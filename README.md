# CPlusPlusGrocerProj

This project involved opening a text file with various foods and produce. I need to organize that data and take inventory of each item. Then I had to quantify that data by number and by histogram. 

The loops I created for the histogram were by best aspect of the project. I needed to create a nested loop that would add characters to a line for every item there was. Then skip to the next food/line once every character was printed. 

I regret not naming the initial text file properly and I also wish that I organized the characters on the histogram better. I would have out an additional space between each character. 

Dealing with both files was difficult right away. The file I created was not having any data added to it. I blamed the created file for a bit, then realized that initial text file was the problem. This challenge taught me to thinbk outside the box and check for problems in places that seem perfectly fine. 

This project taught me to have good time management and move on temporarily from sections giving me trouble. Anytime I got stuck on a loop or aspect of the project, I would give 15-20 minutes to figure it out. Then I would move on work on something else. I usually figured out the solution while I was dealing with other parts of the assignment. 

I made sure to organize all my code nicely and put clear and concise notes where needed. I also made sure there was plenty of whitespace to make sure component was legible and easy to understand.
